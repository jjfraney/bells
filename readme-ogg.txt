  tools lmms and audacity

  lmms:
	1) need a bell sample: here, one with no royalty, was downloaded from web.
	(any sample is ok....this one with non-commercial permission,
	a re-use for non-commercial applicaition, from www.orangefreesounds.com,
	the name of the bell file from this source is 'church-bell-single-hit',
	'http://www.orangefreesounds.com/church-bell/'

	2) the sample was read into lmms linux tool using the 'AudioFileProcessor'.
	This plugin has the ability to change the pitch of the bell sound, and
	allows us to lay down a 'track' using a piano-roll technique.

	3) the westminster chimes.  wikipedia for the details.
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters
	there are 5 patterns of 4 notes.  An lmms 'song' was
	laid for each pattern, and an audio file created.

	4) the bell has a long sustain (training resonance).  This
	bell is beautiful and rich.  However, the sustain is not needed
	in the middle of the sequence....only at the end.  So, two
	songs were created for each westminster pattern.  sustain-short
	and sustain long.
